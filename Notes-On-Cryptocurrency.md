# Centre

[Centre](https://www.centre.io/usdc) is an open source, smart contract-based stablecoin

True financial interoperability requires a price stable means of value exchange. Centre’s technology for fiat-backed stablecoins brings stability to crypto. The initial implementation is USD Coin (USDC), available as an :

- Ethereum ERC-20, 
- Algorand ASA, 
- Avalanche ERC-20, 
- Flow FT, 
- Hedera SDK, 
- Solana SPL, 
- Stellar asset, and 
- TRON TRC-20, 

Creating possibilities in payments, lending, investing, trading and trade finance and the ecosystem will grow as other fiat currency tokens are added.



**Dollar digital currency**

Multichain USDC Swap API is designed to meet the needs of wallets, exchanges, custodians and other digital dollar stablecoin applications, reducing the friction to convert USDC across supported chains at no cost.
