# Notes



# Centre

[Centre](https://www.centre.io/usdc) is an open source, smart contract-based stablecoin

True financial interoperability requires a price stable means of value exchange. Centre’s technology for fiat-backed stablecoins brings stability to crypto. The initial implementation is USD Coin (USDC), available as an :

- Ethereum ERC-20, 
- Algorand ASA, 
- Avalanche ERC-20, 
- Flow FT, 
- Hedera SDK, 
- Solana SPL, 
- Stellar asset, and 
- TRON TRC-20, 

Creating possibilities in payments, lending, investing, trading and trade finance and the ecosystem will grow as other fiat currency tokens are added.



# Cross-chain Swapping

Cross-chain swapping in the Circle Account means it's also easier than ever to swap Polygon USDC for native USDC across [eight other supported blockchains](https://www.circle.com/en/multichain-usdc). 

1. [ETHEREUM USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/ethereum)
2. [ALGORAND USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/algorand)
3. [SOLANA USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/solana)
4. [STELLAR USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/stellar)
5. [TRON USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/tron)
6. [HEDERA USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/hedera)
7. [AVALANCHE USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc-multichain/avalanche)

# **Dollar Digital Currency**

Multichain USDC Swap API is designed to meet the needs of wallets, exchanges, custodians and other digital dollar stablecoin applications, reducing the friction to convert USDC across supported chains at no cost.

# Polygon Bridge

Polygon USDC is a ‘bridged’ version of USDC, which is created when the ‘native’ version of USDC on Ethereum is bridged to the Polygon network via the [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/). A bridge connects two blockchains and enables users to bring digital assets from one chain to the other.

# Polygon

Polygon USDC offers fast and efficient transactions, typically at a fraction of the cost of sending USDC on the Ethereum network. Known as a ‘layer 2’ scaling solution, Polygon is designed to run decentralized applications (dApps) built for Ethereum, enabling developers to easily scale their dApps to run on faster, more efficient infrastructure and unlock access to Web3 commerce, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs and more for a broad set of new users. As of May 2022, Polygon already hosts more than 19,000 dApps and over 2.7 million monthly active wallets. [1]
